    <img id='medinaBayeImage' src='medina baye.jpg' alt='Medina Baye, Senegal. Where Shaykh Abdoul Wadoud is from.'>
    <p>Shaykh Abdoul Wadoud began his studies at a young age in Ghana. During his early teen years, he moved to Senegal
        to continue studying in Medina Baye under the guidance Shaykh Hassan Cisse and later on Shaykh Mahy Cisse. He
        travelled to Mauritania with other students of Shaykh Mahy Cisse and studied Arabic and Islam there thoroughly
        before moving to Cairo, Egypt to complete his studies at the University of al-Azhar. In 2021, Shaykh Abdoul Wadoud
        married the only love he could ever have, the Khadija to his Muhammed pbuh, and they now have been blessed with
        a beautiful baby girl. May she be a scholar of the knowers of Allah. And exemplify the way of the prophet Muhammed
        pbuh.
